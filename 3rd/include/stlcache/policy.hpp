    /*! \brief Abstract interface of a cache entries expiration policy.
     *
     * policy class defines, what methods are expected by \link stlcache::cache cache \endlink from the policy. Usually you will never be using this class directly,
     * but it is you key for writing your custom policies. Actually the policy classes, that you are using with the \link stlcache::cache cache \endlink
     * are just wrappers over real policy implementation (derived from the policy interface), used for binding. So you are able to add your own
     * template parameters to your policies, like we are doing it in a \link stlcache::policy_lfuaging LFU-Aging policy \endlink
     *
     * The goal of writing such policy classes is to provide a \link stlcache::cache cache \endlink with a several, configurable cache expiration
     * implementations. The policy should know about keys of the entries in the cache and it must be able to give a cache one or several entries that are 'expired'
     * and could be removed from it. So the interface is targeted to this goal.
     *
     * For example, the \link stlcache::policy_none None policy \endlink is implemented in the following way:
     *
     * \code
     *    template <class Key, template <typename T> class Allocator> class _policy_none_type : public policy<Key,Allocator> {
     *         //Skipping actual implementation of abstract methods
     *     };
     *
     *     struct policy_none {
     *       template <typename Key, template <typename T> class Allocator>
     *          struct bind : _policy_none_type<Key,Allocator> {
     *             bind(const bind& x) : _policy_none_type<Key,Allocator>(x)  { }
     *             bind(const size_t& size) : _policy_none_type<Key,Allocator>(size) { }
     *         };
     *     };
     *
     *     \endcode
     *
     *     Details of the implementation of the any of the policies are not documented and subject to change, but you still may read the sources.
     *
     *     All policies are configured with the cache's key type and used allocator. It is expected, that policy uses supplied allocator type when doing internal
     *     memory allocations.
     *
     *     \tparam <Key> The cache's Key data type
     *     \tparam <Allocator> Type of the allocator object used to define the allocation model.
